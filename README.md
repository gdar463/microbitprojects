# Micro:Bit Projects

My Micro:Bit projects

## Installing

Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you haven't already, then execute in a terminal:  
```
git clone https://github.com/gdar463/microbitprojects.git
```
Flash on the Micro:Bit the bitio.hex file.  
If you haven't before, install python with pip and add to path python (with installer or manually).  
Execute the requirements.py  

## What's in this mess

At the moment there's:  
- KeyOuse, that uses the accelormeter as a way to press keys and move the cursor.
    - There are two versions:
        - norKeyOuse.py, for normal use case so only mouse and 2 keys
        - gamKeyOuse.py, meant for games so WASD, mouse and 2 keys
